    <p>The realization is starting to seep in - it always takes a while with me. I’m impatient to find out where I’m at - more information on Thursday, unless they want more tests.  I still sleep fairly well, fortunately, but the quiet moments are full of questions.  I’m starting to work through what having cancer will mean.</p>

<p>I think after 40+ years of life I’ve finally grown to like my own appearance.  I’ve found my own style and am fairly OK with my body shape.  Changes to come: my breasts are going to be either partially or completely removed, my hair will fall out.  I’ll finally find out what I’d look like bald. Or with a wig.  Yay!</p>

<p>Strangely my whole body perception is changed already.  I feel frail and breakable, like the wind could blow me away - unusual for me since I’m tall and fit.  My senses are in fight-or-flight mode. Everything more vivid and detailed.  The crowds in the street feel more alien, like their preoccupations are very different from mine.</p>

<p>For the January sales, no fashion for me:  I’ll be looking for fluffy slippers, comfy pijamas and cosy cardigans.</p>

<p>I have more cuddles with my husband and daughter, and they feel more intense.  More conversations with my other family.</p>

<p>I’ve come to like my life, and was fairly happy with the way things were going - and maybe I will again at some point.  I guess that’s what ‘life is change’ means - you can’t really count on the status quo, the situation is going to continue moving around you.</p>
