    <p>So far, so good -</p>

<h2 id="meditation">Meditation</h2>
<p>I’ve been practicing meditation for the last couple of years - I use the phone app Headspace for convenience.
Fun fact: there’s actually a ‘Coping with Cancer’ pack in Headspace.</p>

<p>Why is meditation very useful?</p>
<ul>
  <li>when you have cancer (and in many other situations) it doesn’t pay to look ahead, or to dwell in the past.  Much to easy to speculate and increase anxiety. Staying in the now is incredibly effective in keeping calm.  And let’s face it, the now is usually a pretty good place to be, it’s not like we live in a post-apocalyptic hell.</li>
  <li>interrupting emotional loops: have you ever noticed that it’s very easy to get angrier when angry, or to get more anxious or sad when you already are?  We have a kind of feedback mechanism going, where we validate for ourselves how we feel, and in doing so discover even more reasons to be angry/sad/anxious. Being able to interrupt those loops is very, very handy. Also works against earworms, so extra bonus there.</li>
  <li>tentatively: there is some experimental evidence that meditation can actually improve the healing process. At a basic level, I guess it’s plain common sense that someone calm who manages to sleep full nights will have more energy to get better.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>The nurses and my family all agreed that I needed to pace myself once starting chemo. So I took it to heart and behaved as if I was made of fine china - which turned out to be a little excessive. I feel mostly fine for 2 weeks out of three, so I can definitely some cardio in.  Sure, I’m not going to run marathons (wasn’t before anyway), and the chemo probably acts like the opposite of doping, but exercise is a massive mood booster. I started feeling better as soon as I got back on the bandwagon.
I get yoga at work, and that’s pretty good as well, as an extra relaxation technique and a way to stretch out.</p>

<h2 id="maslows-pyramid">Maslow’s pyramid</h2>
<p>Let’s not forget: an important cause of stress (besides, you know, the disease) are the practicalities. Will this cause me my job? Will we be able to pay rent? Can I ensure my loved one have a reasonably comfortable lifestyle? What if I’m incapacitated?</p>

<p>I was lucky. I changed jobs in October (well, I was sort of forced to) to a large company. Large companies have the capacity and the procedures to deal with health crises, and benefits include insurance against it.</p>

<p>Macmillan Cancer helps people finding benefits in case they don’t have a stable income or financial difficulties. In any case, it is a good idea to start looking into it early on, for two reasons: sometimes the treatment can take its toll and make it harder to concentrate on those things, and the paperwork can also take time.</p>

<h2 id="friends-and-family">Friends and Family</h2>
<p>I moved to Bath only a little less than 3 years ago. I worked remotely a large chunk of that time, and not being the most socially egregious person in the world, I’m only starting to build a modest network of acquaintances.
But I have a supportive husband and a daughter, so at least I’m not alone - and my extended family is in touch frequently.
I can’t imagine what it must be like to go through this kind of thing alone, with nobody to talk to. Definitely need that occasional chat and lots of hugs.</p>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>I’ve long classified my acquaintances between two groups: the people who love food, its taste, its texture, for whom food is an integral part of enjoying life, and the people who find it an inconvenience and would rather drink a nutrient brew or take a pill so that they can get on with other more interesting things.</p>

<p>I’ve long thought I was somewhere on the spectrum close to the first category: I love food but when I’m hungry I’ll pretty much eat anything.</p>

<p>This simple model doesn’t take an important dimension into account: appetite. Soon after the chemo the appetite goes. Turns out I’m pretty weird, in that I still enjoy taste and texture of food, even when I’m slightly queasy. I’ve learned to plan to tasty foods especially in the days right after chemo, because otherwise it’s hard work to eat.</p>

<p>To go even further, I still really enjoy cooking, and reading my favourite food porn, Delicious magazine, and plotting future food adventures.</p>

<h2 id="normal">Normal</h2>
<p>And again, saved by that fantastic narrow focus we humans have. We wouldn’t be able to function if we thought of our mortality, the very probable extinction of our race or crumbling of our civilization, the fact that we’re just a tiny blip in time and space.
Fortunately we’re very good at forgetting all of that big picture stuff and focusing on what’s in front of us.
I’m saved by routine: taking care of my daughter, working, household, the normal stuff. Plenty there to keep the brain occupied, and forget about the tricksy cells most of the time.</p>
