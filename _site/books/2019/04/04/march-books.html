    <p>I started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism">The Age of Surveillance capitalism</a> - not very far yet. It’s interesting, but it’s also written in a very academic style - a lot of context and discussion of angles and assumptions, and if I have to be honest, a bit long-winded for me - could do with a TL;DR version. But the nuggets of interesting will keep me coming back.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373688-revenant-gun">Revenant Gun (Machineries of Empire book 3)</a>: satisfying last of a trilogy I started reading a while ago. Yoon Ha Lee (american writer) creates an interesting universe, where the laws of physics themselves are influenced by the religious calendar people in that region of space follow. Unfortunately calendars sometime contain ‘remembrances’, ritualized torture, and ‘heretics’ have to be found to offer up on those occasions. A mix of quasi-magical technology, asian baroque and slightly inscrutable battle tactics, it makes for a good adventure read.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9561862/">Love, death &amp; robots</a>: shorts TV on Netflix. Format bit like the Twilight Zone, every story detached. Also interesting is the variety of media, from film to CGI to anime to cell shading. Not all equal in quality, but thought provoking, fun and short.</p>

<p>For next month, I’ve got the latest Expanse novel (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28335698-tiamat-s-wrath">Tiamat’s Wrath, number 8</a>) lined up! Can’t wait, the story keeps on expanding, epically building on the proto-molecule/ancient destroyed civilization context.  The series is scheduled to end with number 9, which is good - would be disappointing to have it fizzle.</p>
