The title is based on Murakami's "What I talk about when I talk about running". Very clearly this is not that. Murakami's book is clearly based on years and years of diaries, written in his typical poetic style, with the fluency of a professional. He's also taking running to its extreme, first running marathons and then tackling triathlons.Â  My own version is looking back at years and years of lackadaisical, amateur jogging, none too intensive but still one of the few constants punctuating my teenage and adult years. What the his and mine have in common is that we use running as a lens we remember our life through.

I guess I can trace my running habits to teenage years 15-18. My parents encouraged us to have a regular schedule of after-school activities - in Belgium school doesn't provide them, so it's up to parents to sort it out - a bit of music, a bit of sports, a bit of whatever we fancied. I've been a jack-of-all-trades forever, trying a succession of sports for a year or two and then moving on.

I don't remember what motivated me to start athletics that year. There was a club operating on the local running track in town, within biking distance. Probably my mother proposed it, and I went "yes, alright, I'll give it a go", and somehow kept at it.

I wasn't particularly good. There were some local track stars, club favourites, who received special attention and were taken around competitions in the region. I wasn't one of them. In fact, I couldn't even imagine me being one of them - I wasn't competitive at all, not in this field. I think I'd already decided sports were a secondary activity for me.  Brain was where I was going to excel. In the meantime I was going through the motions, getting exercise because it was expected of me, not really questioning it but not being too enthousiastic about it either.

I didn't really enjoy it, and I didn't really mind either - I found some running companions to chat to as we circled the track. I had a crush on one of the better runners, a lanky dark-eyed boy who was a couple of years older than me, but looked smooth faced and androgynous enough not to scare my teenage self off. While we ran round and round the red polyurethane track I snuck glances at his light-footed frame, not even dreaming of starting a chat.

Not that there was any reciprocity. At the time it felt like all the boys at the club fancied this one girl. She was skinny and blonde. I suppose she was pretty. Most of all, she seemed to have been born with superior heat exchange superpowers. Where at the end of the training most of us were panting, red faced and sweating, she floated of the track looking like she'd just modeled for a sports wear ad. What was even the point. On top of that she was of the 'mean girl' variety, eyeing us mortals with the a sneer that probably hid some insecurity, but didn't make her any more likeable.

When we were in our twenties, ten years later, my high school best friend invited me over to watch the Mister Belgium finals on TV, an event I previously wasn't even aware of. My athletics crush was one of the finalists! We drank some wine and giggled our way through the event. He got second place, which shows that at my taste was mainstream. The fact he participated at all is a pretty solid indication that it wouldn't have worked out.

Back to the athletics, the reason I lasted a full three years is that I tried a bunch of disciplines. I ran for a while, trying different distances, doing ok in longish sprints like 400 and 800m. Then I switched to hurdles for a bit, which was interesting, but I didn't have the explosive speed you need for it. So I drifted over to throwing stuff, like javelines, disks and hammers, with the more sturdy girls. While I didn't shine at it either, it was something else to try.

Showing that for me, running didn't start with a flash and a bang, like a romantic lifetime infatuation. I didn't run and go 'I feel wonderful, this is what I want to do, forever'. It was vaguely satisfying. It was a way to sweat off those pesky hormones, to stay fit. I got to check out some nice legs from afar. It was ok.
