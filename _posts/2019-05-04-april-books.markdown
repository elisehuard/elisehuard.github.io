Lots of books this month, probably because I had more time off than usual, combining a week of actual holiday with my penultimate chemotherapy session.

[The Age of Surveillance capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism?ac=1&from_search=true): still plowing through it, hopefully finishing this month.

[On Writing: A memoir of the Craft](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing?from_search=true): Stephen King's manual on writing. I used to read Stephen King as a young teenager.  His books were available at the library, and my friends were reading them too - my first more communal reading experience. I remember even then not really liking what I was reading - King's characters were often unlikeable, petty, smelly and human, not what you look for when you want escape - and horror isn't really my thing anyway. But his skill is undeniable, and the yarns still pulled me in, and after reading them the dark always felt a little bit too crowded. His memoir/manual is an enjoyable read by itself, and it contains a good few practical tips that should help writers get better, or at least get started.

[Tiamat's Wrath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38608575-the-quantum-magician?ac=1&from_search=true): The Expanse, still going strong! The crew of the Rocinante, having gone separate ways, are part of the resistance against Duarte. There's intrigue, emotional moments, mystery, and a resolution. As far as I understand the series will end with number 9, and I can't wait to read it.

[The Quantum Magician](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38608575-the-quantum-magician?ac=1&from_search=true): a heist story with a philosophical twist. In this future world, humanity has been branched out by geneticists in three mal-adjusted races, who each struggle with what they've been engineered to be. Belisarius, the main protagonist, is a Homo Quantus, a variety of human who has extra senses and the ability to turn himself into a super computer by switching off some part of his brain. He is also a gifted con man, and is pushed into accepting a seemingly impossible job, for which he has to assemble a crew of accomplices. Standard format, but in a different universe.

[Shades of Magic trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22055262-a-darker-shade-of-magic?ac=1&from_search=true): excellent post-chemo book, easy read. Pretty standard fantasy, with an overpowered baddie with an evil plan to take over the world, and a few heroes fighting to save the day. The story flows well, and even though it's predictable and none too subtle, it's still enjoyable.

[Odd Jobs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30519186-oddjobs): not unlike the Laundry Files, it mixes a Lovecraftian theme, spy thriller and humour into an enjoyable, if lightweight read. The book follows members a british secret agency tasked with managing the apocalypse - a race of demons/horrors, the Venislarm, is poised to take over the world.  Nice passage, when a new member of the theme goes through her induction:

> She learned the different sirens that would sound in the event of a fire (a ringing bell), a Venislarm incursion (an intermittent klaxon) and the end of the world (bell and klaxon together).
> "We need an alarm for the end of the world?" she said to Lois. "Why? What are we expected to do about it?"
> "Very little I would imagine" said Lois.
