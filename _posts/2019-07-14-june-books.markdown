[It's all in your head](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23346516-it-s-all-in-your-head) by Suzanne O'Sullivan, a neurologist. I'd say it's in some ways the pendant of [Cure](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25430578-cure) by Jo Marchant: Cure discusses discusses the research on how the mind-body relationship can make you better, It's all in your head is based on O'Sullivan's own experience on how your mind can make you ill, by what's known as psychosomatic disorders. O'Sullivan discusses some cases in a humane and compassionate way, urging doctors and the public alike to understand that suffering is suffering, however it is caused. Psychosomatic disorders are real, they may be an expression of emotions we cannot allow ourselves to feel, and they cause a great deal of damage. I dislike the title because it's quite adverserial and basically makes it impossible to recommend to anyone who might be concerned.

[We sold our souls](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37715859-we-sold-our-souls): entertaining horror story where a washed out metal guitarist slowly realizes that an ex band member sold her soul for success. The whole book is a love song to metal, to the genuine expression of emotion in music, and a rejection of pre-packaged music. It's a fun read.

[Dogs of War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35827220-dogs-of-war) book by Adrian Tchaikovsky, aka the spider guy (he seems to emphasize with insects quite often in his fiction)(OK I know spiders aren't insects, fine). In Dogs of War we follow the journey of Rex, a bio-engineered dog cyborg created to lead an attack team, and another mysterious intelligence who sees it as her duty to get Rex accepted as a creature deserving rights. The dog and his peers have to contend with prejudice and narrow-mindedness. Loveable book celebrating difference and acceptance.

[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1618.The_Curious_Incident_of_the_Dog_in_the_Night_Time): not a recent book. The protagonist is a teenage boy who's on the spectrum. The book is written like a journal. The boy finds his neighbour's dog body and resolves to find out who did it. It alternates between funny when he tries to decode the situations around him and gets it very wrong, and harrowing when we understand how hard it is for him to function in an ever-changing, crowded world.

OK, I gave up on [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism). The style of the book got on my nerves - how to put it? The author took ages to get to the point. I'd pay money for a good summary.
