In november I participated to NaNoWriMo: National Novel Writing Month. Started in the US in xxxx, now worldwide. The challenge: write 50000 words - a novel's worth of words - in a month. This comes down to a little less than 1750 words per day. I've wanted to participate for years, but never quite got round to it - life got in the way, or I forgot and remembered mid-november. It was time.

### Preptober
I completely missed that Nanowrimo is preceded by Preptober: a month to prepare your novel. I came to regret missing preparation - it's much easier to write a novel when you have laid out the groundwork. I figure next time I write a book I'll try to:
* have an overal plotline - or timeline - or set of plotlines
* do research into less familiar areas - read books on related topics for inspiration. How does the air smell when you come out of the plane in Bamako?
* have a little bit of profile around main characters
Once you have the plot laid out in broad lines, keeping a coherent, consistent thread is easier, and you can just concentrate on the writing instead of figuring things out as you go. Research can be an extra source of inspiration, adding aspects of plot that make everything more realistic, adding texture.

But to balance that, there is a spectrum of preparation: some writers prefer to write blind and let the characters shape the story. Also writing a long form without preparation did help me figure out what would help, which I would not have known beforehand.

### The website
Nanowrimo is backed by a non-profit which is dedicated to enabling everyone to write their 50000 words. There is a website which helps you track stats. They have the gamification down: the graph of progress is really helpful in seeing whether you're on track.

More importantly, they point wannabe participants to their region's chapter: every region in the world has a few organizers who organize the community. Which brings me to next point.

### The community
I'm not entirely sure I would have finished it without the Bristol & Bath writers group. We had a discord channel, and during the whole month there were other participants online to encourage flagging writers. It was a good place to moan, to exchange banter with other fellow sufferers. You could try and help each other out when you were blocked, or rubber duck a finer plot point, or cheer on someone who'd written more than they'd expected to.

There were sprints: 15 minutes stretches where people competitively tried to produce as many words as possible, and then recorded the result in the channel. You then got XP from the resident bot, and leveled up accordingly.

There were regular physical write-ins too, get-togethers in a cafe or a restaurant where everyone brought their laptop or notepad and sat writing together while drinking beverages.

I was surprised by the number of participants in the region. I think there were about 20 of us who finished it in Bath and Bristol alone. Some of the people had participated for many years. Some, interestingly, got their 50000 words written in the first 10 days, literal human avalanches of the written word.

### Flow
Nanowrimo is a marathon-worthy effort. I struggle to write a 1000 words in a day, let alone 1750. And I had to start grafting after having worked a full day and having put my daughter to bed. It was physically exhausting.
But it became easier after a while. I got into a groove of planning my next steps in the morning commute on the train, when brain wasn't too fried yet, which meant that I could just execute on the ideas in the evening. There was a trick to progress: which situation do I want the plot to move to, and how do I set it up?
Getting into the habit of writing down ideas in my notebook when they popped up. Trying to produce more in the weekends on off moments, to compensate for difficult week nights.

I spoke to another Bath amateur writer who said that she doesn't participate to nanowrimo anymore: she prefers to write less, but over a longer period of time. I think that is wise, because it's more sustainable - I was pretty burned out for most of December, and only now do I feel I could start writing again.

While I have my reservations about the process, I found it a valuable experience. Forcing myself to write high volumes of questionable prose did unblock the writing, and highlighted what was missing in my process and style. I'm not sure I'll be able to use the output - not without rewriting it - but I did push through, from start to finish, and in so doing proved myself it could be done.

I think the next challenge is editing a draft and make it work properly. I don't have a very clear idea how to do it - it might be even harder, and more strenuous, than writing the first draft. I'm pretty pig-headed though. The journey continues.
