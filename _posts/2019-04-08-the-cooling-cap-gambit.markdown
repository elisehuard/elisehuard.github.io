For those who don't know, the cooling cap is a torture device cancer patients can place upon their heads to cool (freeze) their head skin while the chemo drugs are being administered. This diminishes the hair loss to a certain extent, as the follicles aren't hit with the full dose during the session. I've decided to go with it for now.

The crucial question: will the end of chemo come before we reach the intersection?
