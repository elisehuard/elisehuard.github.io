[Command and Control](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452798-command-and-control), a book about the nuclear arms race, has been on my list for a long time, and I finally got round to it.  It's thorough, nerdy, and well put together.  Without expressing a political view directly, it manages to convey the absurdity of the development and deployment of ever more destructive weaponry.  Actual real life horror, humans at their worst and their most stupid.  Darwin awards at a planetary level.

[Who fears death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7767021-who-fears-death) was this month's book club book. I wasn't that taken with Binti which was YA, but this story is definitely not for children. It's the life story of a young woman born from rape, who has extraordinary powers and an epic destiny. The setting is Africa in either the distant past or the far future, with two ethnic groups, one bent on exterminating the other. Managing to be harrowing, a page turner and thought-provoking all at the same time.

[A discovery of witches](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8667848-a-discovery-of-witches) don't trust Kindle recommendations - this was the miss of the month. It reads like paranormal romance between cardboard cut-outs.

[Brooklyn Nine-Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nine-Nine)  Late to this party, I tried a few episodes a while ago and wasn't convinced.  But I pushed through after my brother talked me into it and saw the light.  Small nuggets of well-scripted joy - back to the mood engineering, this does the trick on a slumpy midweek evening.

For march I have [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism) on my list, it sounds like an intriguing read, I'm looking forward to it.
