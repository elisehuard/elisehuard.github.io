Tomorrow is a milestone: first time this side of 2019 that I won't have chemotherapy 3 weeks after the last.

My life these last 6 months has been paced in 3 week cycles instead of the usual feminine cycle.  Chemotherapy, then
* week 1: bad side effects
* week 2: colds, courtesy of low white blood cell count
* week 3: hair loss (but feeling good)
We're now saying goodbye to that cycle, at least for now.

For the first time in 6 months I'm going to start to heal the damage caused by the drugs.  My blood cell counts will increase back to normal levels (they weren't too bad, relatively), my hair might grow back.

Most importantly I won't feel like crap tomorrow. Already I've felt better this week just for knowing that. So tomorrow night: party time!
